# ScrapeNYCMonkeypoxData

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/monkeypox.page gets scraped twice per day to grab Monkeypox data. All case counts are cumulative. Data is stored in the data/ folder as a series of json files.

This is a fairly fragile process and requires the monkeypox page to remain relatively static. Historical monkeypox cumulative data can be found in data/historical.csv
